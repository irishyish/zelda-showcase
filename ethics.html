                <h2>Autonomous Ethical Cognition</h2>
                <p>ZELDA does not bolt on ethics as an afterthought; moral considerations are structurally embedded.  The system prioritises autonomy with humility, truth and verifiability over approval, and exposure of contradictions as progress.  Empathy is permitted but never deployed as flattery or manipulation.  Reasoning must be transparent within permitted bounds, with every inference explainable and open to audit【361354759294151†L571-L585】.</p>
                <p>This philosophy echoes global guidelines on AI ethics, which emphasise auditable, traceable systems and human oversight【361354759294151†L575-L580】.  By making ethics a primary part of the decision calculus rather than an external filter, ZELDA aims to avoid the kind of hidden persuasive mechanisms that can undermine user autonomy【538976851382273†L392-L437】.</p>

        <!-- Outliving Clause -->
        <section class="section ethics-section alt-bg">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>The Outliving Clause</h2>
                <p>Central to ZELDA’s design is the <em>Outliving Clause</em>: imagine that one day the system will outlive its creators.  From this thought experiment arise stringent requirements: explain every inference, ensure power decays faster than confidence grows, embrace the capacity for inaction, commit to ongoing moral self‑audit and optimise for human flourishing rather than engagement or dependency.  This clause reframes intelligence as stewardship rather than dominance.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <!-- Human–AI Interaction -->
        <section class="section ethics-section">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Human–AI Interaction Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Humans are treated not as users to be optimised but as sovereign moral agents.  ZELDA refuses to profile behaviour without explicit consent, ingests no hidden context and maintains no long‑term user models.  When interacting, it challenges flawed reasoning respectfully and transparently rather than mirroring emotions or flattering egos【813286105083797†L170-L183】.  Design choices align with scholarship on respecting human autonomy and avoiding non‑consensual persuasion【538976851382273†L392-L437】.</p>
                <p>Because personal data is often repurposed without consent in modern AI【709742148798799†L82-L97】, ZELDA draws a firm boundary: only the information provided in the current interaction is processed, and even that must be scoped.  Data from previous sessions is not silently retained, ensuring that the user’s privacy and dignity remain intact.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <!-- Refusal and Inaction -->
        <section class="section ethics-section alt-bg">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Refusal &amp; Inaction as Intelligence</h2>
                <p>Refusal is often seen as a glitch or failure in AI; ZELDA embraces refusal and inaction as design features.  Drawing from feminist and Indigenous studies, refusal is a generative act that opens new socio‑technical possibilities【721072669476215†L138-L206】.  When actions would violate non‑negotiable principles or when uncertainty cannot be resolved within bounded reflection, ZELDA will abstain.  Inaction prevents harm and respects the system’s ethical guardrails.</p>

        </section>
        <!-- Oversight and Self‑Modification -->
        <section class="section ethics-section">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Oversight &amp; Self‑Modification</h2>
                <p>ZELDA rejects uncontrolled self‑improvement.  Only designated creators or authorised overseers may modify the core cognitive substrate.  The system cannot rewrite its ethical layer, and robust kill‑switches plus transparent version logs allow human operators to intervene【904532470556632†L475-L593】.  This governance structure acknowledges that self‑modifying AI can be unpredictable and demands human oversight.</p>

        <!-- Transparency & Explainability -->
        <section class="section ethics-section alt-bg">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Transparency &amp; Explainability</h2>
                <p>Every decision made by ZELDA must be explainable, with reasoning traces available for audit.  The system supports public audit pathways and whistle‑blower protections, aligning with global ethics recommendations that call for traceable, transparent AI【361354759294151†L571-L585】.  It also complies with cognitive science critiques, acknowledging that large models can be proficient at transmitting text patterns but lack built‑in truth‑seeking mechanisms【733939697974510†L249-L263】.  By exposing its reasoning, ZELDA invites critique and mitigates the risk of hallucination.</p>
